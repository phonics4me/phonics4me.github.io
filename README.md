Games and Resources for Learning to Read using Synthetic Phonics

### What is Synthetic Phonics?

Synthetic Phonics, also known as Blended Phonics in the US, is one of three broad approaches for teaching reading to young native English speakers.

* Whole Language
* Analytic Phonics
* Synthetic Phonics

All three can be effective methods for teaching reading and are often used in combination in the classroom. But some students still struggle learning to read and may benefit from a more focused approach with Synthetic Phonics.
