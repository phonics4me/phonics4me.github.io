<p>Synthetic Phonics, also known as Blended Phonics in the US, is one of three broad approaches for teaching reading to young native English speakers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Whole Language</li>
<li>Analytic Phonics</li>
<li>Synthetic Phonics</li>
</ul><p>All three can be effective methods for teaching reading and are often used in combination in the classroom.  But some students still struggle learning to read and may benefit from a more focused approach with Synthetic Phonics.</p>
